# Unsupervised and supervised multivariate data analysis
Unsupervised and supervised multivariate data analysis for FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy 

Investigations into fentanyl precursors method classification by handheld Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis

Recommended build:
  Anaconda Navigator (Anaconda Software Distribution, version 2.1.1),
  Jupyter Notebook (Project Jupyter, version 6.4.5), and
  Python (Python Software Foundation, version 3.9.7).

Required libraries:
  Pandas library (version 1.3.4) for Python was used for importing the .csv files and formation of DataFrames,
  NumPy library (version 1.20.3) was used for the generation of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices with its numerical mathematics extension,
  matplotlib library (version 3.4.3), to produce plots and graphs, and
  scikit-learn machine learning library (version 0.24.2) for Python was used first to pre-process the data prior to any multivariate analysis.

Example data with samples with class (x axis) and observations (y axis). This example data is Raman spectra between 500 - 1800 cm-1.
